# Introduction to DataFrames

Data scientists are a new breed of analytical data expert who have the technical skills to solve complex problems – and the curiosity to explore what problems need to be solved.
They’re part mathematician, part computer scientist and part trend-spotter. And, because they straddle both the business and IT worlds, they’re highly sought-after and well-paid. Who wouldn’t want to be one?  They’re also a sign of the times. Data scientists weren’t on many radars a decade ago, but their sudden popularity reflects how businesses now think about big data. That unwieldy mass of unstructured information can no longer be ignored and forgotten. It’s a virtual gold mine that helps boost revenue – as long as there’s someone who digs in and unearths business insights that no one thought to look for before. Enter the data scientist.
